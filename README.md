# Cryptography Algorithms
 
This is a repository meant to hold some simple implementations of cryptography methods.
 
# Algorithms
## Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher (or shift cipher) is a simple substitution cipher, replacing every character of the open text with a character a fixed distance down the alphabet.  This implementation preserves capitalization, and will not cipher non-alphanumeric characters.

## Vernam Cipher
A fairly simple encryption method that generates a random 'key' used to encrypt a bit of text.  The key is the same length as the text itself, and each character of the text is XORed against its corresponding number in the key.

## Affine Cipher
## ROT13
## Vigen√®re cipher
## Diffie-Hellman

## Testing
Tests are written in mocha and may require this library be installed.

ex:

```sh
sudo npm install -g mocha
```

Otherwise, ```npm run test ``` will execute the tests.
